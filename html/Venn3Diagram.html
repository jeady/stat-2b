Venn diagrams are a way of visualizing sets.
This applet lets you highlight the set A, the set B, the universal set S,
the empty set {}, the complement of A (Ac), the complement of B (Bc),
the intersection of A and B (AB), the union of A and B (A or B),
the intersection of the complement of A with B (AcB), and
the intersection of A with the
complement of B (ABc).
One can think of the relative area of a set to the area of S as a
probability.
The picture uses that analogy: the numbers P(A) and P(B) are proportional to
the area of A and the area of B, respectively; P(AB) is the area of the
intersection of A and B, and P(A or B) is the area of the union of A and B.

You can drag the <a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#event">events</a>
A and B around, which changes the probability of their intersection
and of their union.
When A and B do not overlap, they are said to be
<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#disjoint">disjoint or mutually exclusive</a>.
When the probability of the intersection of A and B
equals the product
of the probability of A and the probability of B (when P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B)),
A and B are
<a href="../SticiGui/Text/gloss.htm#independent">independent</a>.
Try to drag A or B to make P(AB) = P(A)&times;P(B);
notice how hard it is to make the overlap just
right: independence is a very special relationship between events.
The scrollbars let you adjust the probability of A and the probability of
B.
