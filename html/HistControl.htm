    This applet lets you take &quot;slices&quot; through a
    multivariate data set to compare the distribution of a variable
    without regard for the values of the other variables with the
    distribution of that variable when the value of one or more of
    the other variables is restricted to some range; that is, the
    distribution for just those individuals in the data set for which
    the other variables are all in the specified ranges.
</p>

<p>
    The blue histogram (yellow when highlighted) shows the
    distribution of the selected variable for the entire data set.
    The green histogram (magenta when highlighted) shows the
    distribution of the selected variable for only those members of
    the population whose measurement on other variables are in the
    ranges specified near the bottom of the applet. The means and SDs
    of the overall and restricted values, as well as the overall
    number of individuals and the number in the restricted group, are
    given at the bottom. Using the scrollbars or text entry areas,
    you can select a range of values and see how the area of the
    histograms the selected range differs between the restricted and
    unrestricted groups; you can also see the normal curves (blue for
    the blue histogram; green for the green histogram) and the area
    under the normal curve corresponding to the selected region of
    the histograms.
</p>

<p>
The bins are plotted in such a way that if both the
unrestricted and restricted histograms have a positive height in
a given class interval, the shorter one is &quot;in front,&quot;
so that you see the taller one sticking up beyond it. If the two
have exactly the same height in a given bin, the restricted one
(green or magenta, depending on whether or not it is highlighted)
plots in front, so only it is visible.
</p>

<p>You can select one of three data sets, <a
href="ScatterPlot.htm#ccv_data">CCV (emissions of EPA test
vehicles in 96 tests)</a>, <a href="ScatterPlot.htm#cities_data">Cities
(homeless rates and several other variables possibly related to
homelessness for 50 cities)</a>, and <a
href="ScatterPlot.htm#gmat_data">GMAT (GMAT scores, undergraduate
GPAs and first-year MBA GPAs for 913 students)</a>. From each
data set you can choose a histogram of one of several variables,
and you can superpose the histogram of that variable for just
those cases where it and other variables are in specified ranges.
It is interesting to compare such slices with
scatterplots of these variables.</p>

<h2 align="center">Explanation of the Applet Controls</h2>


<p align="left">The choice boxes

above the histogram allow you to choose

which data set to look at, and which variable in that data set to

plot a histogram of. The check boxes above the histogram

control whether the histogram

of the original, unrestricted data is plotted (blue in the

unhighlighted regions and yellow where highlighted), and/or the

histogram of the data that remain after the restrictions are

applied (green in the unhighlighted regions and magenta where

highlighted).</p>



<p align="left">The three text boxes and scroll bars just under

the histogram control the lower endpoint of the range to

highlight, the upper endpoint of the range to highlight, and the

number of bins in the histogram, respectively. You can either use

the scrollbars to change the values, or type a new value into the

box, followed by the &quot;return&quot; or &quot;enter&quot; key.</p>



<p align="left">
In the next row of controls, the button controls
whether or not normal curves are superposed on the histograms; if
so, the areas under the normal curves for the highlighted parts
of the histograms are displayed. The highlighted areas of the
histograms themselves are always displayed.
</p>


<p>
    The next row of controls allows you to select
    other variables in the current dataset to apply restrictions to,
    and show the histogram of the value of the variable selected on
    the previous line, but for only those individuals whose
    measurements of the variables restricted on this line fall in the
    specified ranges. The first check box specifies
    whether or not you want to restrict the variable selected on this
    line to be larger than some threshold; the threshold is displayed
    in the text area just to the right of &quot;&gt;=&quot;. You can
    change the threshold by typing in a new value, then striking the
    &quot;enter&quot; or &quot;return&quot; key. The next check box
    specifies whether or not you want to constrain the variable
    selected on this line to be less than the threshold value
    displayed in the text area just to the right of
    &quot;&lt;=.&quot; Again, you can change the threshold value by
    typing over it and striking &quot;return&quot; or
    &quot;enter.&quot; The histogram of the remaining values of the
    variable selected on the previous line, after the restrictions
    are applies, is shown in green (magenta where highlighted). Note
    that any restrictions you apply persist when you select a
    different variable on this line; you have to clear them
    individually, or all at once using the &quot;clear
    restrictions&quot; button, which unchecks all the check boxes for
    all the variables, and resets the threshold values to the minimum
    and maximum values of each variable.
</p>

<p>
    The button on the bottom line pops up a
    new window that lists the current dataset.
    The rest of the bottom line shows the number of
    original observations of the variable plotted, the mean and sd of
    those values, the number of observations that remain after the
    restrictions are applied, and the mean and sd of those
    observations.
